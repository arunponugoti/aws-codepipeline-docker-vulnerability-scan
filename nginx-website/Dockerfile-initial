+- AWS CLI installed.
+- AWS CLI is [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) with IAM Access Key, Secret Access Key and Default region as US-EAST-1.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at f7d553e... Update README.md for latest instructions, modify CFN templates to accept Public/Private Subnets as list, remove CodeCommit resource from clair-codepipeline-template.yaml as it is now being created manually
